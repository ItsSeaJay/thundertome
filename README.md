# Thundertome
The Lightning-Fast Publishing Platform

## Description
Thundertome is a bare-bones blog written in [PHP](https://php.net) on top of
the [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com) framework. I was inspired to create
it after stumbling accross this rather amusing (if crass) [website](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com).

It was supposed to be my next big project after finishing the first public
version of
[Firefolio: Online Portfolio System](https://github.com/firefolio/firefolio-ops)
creating my interpretation of what I thought PHP was built for:
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org). Unfortunately, I just discovered
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a markdown-centric blog generator built right
into GitHub itself, which I'm now using for my own personal blog, amongst other
things.

Thundertome itself is currently on hold, but I really do like the name.

## Functionality
All Thundertome can do right now is read blog entries from a database and display
them. You're able to log in, but you can't actually modify the blogs
content without backend access. If you don't mind writing your blog posts in
PHPMyAdmin or the command line, you might still find this useful.
